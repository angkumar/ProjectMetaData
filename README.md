# ProjectMetaData
Project Metadata is a from-scratch deep learning system for histopathology cancer detection. Using a custom CNN built in PyTorch, the model analyzes lymph node tissue image patches (with optional metadata) to classify metastatic cancer. GPU-accelerated and research-focused, built for learning, not diagnosis.
